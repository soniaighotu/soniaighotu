I'm a computer science graduate passionate about cybersecurity and practical problem-solving. I have consistent exposure to security investigation workflows through structured labs, guided simulations, and independent projects. Experienced in analyzing network activity, reviewing system and application behavior, and testing web applications for common security weaknesses. I bring a technical foundation grounded in understanding how systems are built and how they fail, with a strong interest in developing practical judgment across defensive and offensive security roles.

## Projects
### Image Encryption Tool
[View Repository](https://github.com/soniaighotu/image-encryption-tool)  
Educational project exploring how digital images can be encrypted and decrypted by manipulating pixel values. Focused on understanding image data and reversible transformations for basic encryption.

### Caesar Cipher Python
[View Repository](https://github.com/soniaighotu/caesar-cipher-python)  
Implemented the classical Caesar cipher to study substitution encryption techniques and reinforce understanding of basic cryptography principles.

### Packet Sniffer
[View Repository](https://github.com/soniaighotu/Packet-sniffer)  
Captured and analyzed network traffic to understand packet structure, protocols, and network communication patterns in a controlled, ethical environment.
